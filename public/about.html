<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am Rohan Tiwari, a recent graduate in Chemical Engineering from Madan Mohan Malviya University of Technology. 
  My academic foundation is complemented by hands-on experience through internships, such as optimizing chemical 
  processes and sustainability practices at Deoria Paper Mill, and refining environmental compliance improvements 
  at Terra Green Tech. I have cultivated expertise in advanced oxidation processes, with a strong focus on process optimization.
</p>

<p>My greatest strengths lie in my technical expertise and ability to adapt to challenges. Through my academic 
  projects and internships, I’ve honed skills in process optimization, chemical technology, and renewable energy 
  applications. I'm proficient in tools like Aspen Plus and HYSYS, as well as programming languages such as Python and C++.
  Beyond technical abilities, I excel in analytical thinking, problem-solving, and collaboration. I’m detail-oriented and 
  have a proactive approach to identifying and implementing solutions, particularly in research-driven environments.</p>

<p>I tend to be a perfectionist, which sometimes means I focus too much on minor details to ensure accuracy. While this drives 
  high-quality outcomes, I’ve learned to balance this tendency by prioritizing tasks based on impact and deadlines. 
  Additionally, I’m still refining my skills in presenting ideas more succinctly, especially in high-pressure situations. 
  To address this, I’ve actively practiced concise presentations and sought constructive feedback from mentors. I view 
  weaknesses as areas for growth and always strive to improve through self-awareness and actionable steps.</p>
